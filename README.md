# Decentralized Polling System

Developing a decentralized polling system using Solana and incorporating ai agents with Warp. The core idea is to build a decentralized application (dApp) where the polls are created and stored on Solana.

The Decentralized Polling System is essentially a way to run polls without someone such as a server, company, or admin controlling the results, data, or counting. Instead, you would trust a blockchain (Solana) as it provides positive outcomes like:

- Preventing Secretly changed results
- Avoids fake votes
- Anyone can verify the outcome
- The system still fucntions regardless of changes in parties
- User has control of identity through wallets

## Web Application

The idea is to have the "ballot box" on a public blockchain. We'll be creating a web app using React.
